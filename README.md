Module 1 Challenge 1
HTML CSS GIT Challenge
Jaydon Goodrich

I have added semantic HTML elements to the index.html
replacing the generic div tags with header, footer, section and article.

I have updated the structre of the styling elements in style.css to follow the same organization as the index.html. Grouping by section and classes. Added comments to style.css to show organization and breaks between sections.

Updated all image elements to have alt attributes that display what the image is about.

Added an a tag to the h1 in the header to return home when clicked. Also added an id attribute to search engine optimation so the nav link would direct to that section.

Added a title to the html doc to display a descriptive title of the companies home page.

Added additional comments to show organization
